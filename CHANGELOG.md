## Unreleased

### Changed
- Switched CLI output to text-default with stable marker records.
- Added explicit JSON opt-in mode via `--json` / `--output json`.
- Unified parse and runtime failures under one structured error contract.
- Centralized rendering in `src/output/*` with shared view models.
- Rewrote public and internal docs to describe only the new contract:
  - marker grammar: `@@agstage:v1 <kind> <minified-json-payload>`
  - parse/runtime error fields: `version`, `command`, `phase`, `code`, `message`, `exit_code`
